## TD;DR
- use a ScaledObject or ScaledJob to define a connection to a k8s resource that needs to be scaled based on some event
- use a Scaler to define the event source, and when to scale up or down the k8s deployment
- define the ScaledObject or ScaledJob as YAML or whatever format the k8s deployment will accept (eg `az cli` command for AKS)

## Overview

- KEDA: Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaler - single-purpose, light-weight component
    -  drive the scaling of any container in Kubernetes based on the number of events needing to be processed
- by default, k8s has HPA (horizontal pod autoscaling) for autoscaling - only uses CPU and memory as metrics for autoscaling
    - hpa is not event-driven - keda extends hpa functionality
- keda adds 4 custom resources to k8s:
    1. scaledobjects.keda.sh
    2. scaledjobs.keda.sh
    3. triggerauthentications.keda.sh
    4. clustertriggerauthentications.keda.sh
- ScaledObjects represent the desired mapping between an event source (e.g. Rabbit MQ) and the Kubernetes Deployment, StatefulSet or any Custom Resource that defines /scale subresource.
- ScaledJobs represent the mapping between event source and Kubernetes Job.
- ScaledObject/ScaledJob may also reference a TriggerAuthentication

## ScaledObject
- has the following important sections:
    - scaleTargetRef - ref to the k8s resource that should be scaled
        - can be any k8s resource or any custom resource with a scale subresource definition
