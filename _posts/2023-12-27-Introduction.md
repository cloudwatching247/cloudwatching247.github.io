## Hello future me (and other people as well, I guess)

#### Welcome to my little corner of the Internet. In here, you will a hopefully thorough investigation of what I think I know, and why I think I know it.

I'm aiming to use this blog to achieve two goals.

Firstly, it is an attempt to kinda tip over the basket-of-apples of my thoughts and my person, and document, beginning from the basics, my belief system. I will start to put the apples back in, hopefully in a somewhere coherent manner, and chronicle how I got to the incredible belief system that I've managed to cultivate now.

Secondly, I hope to chronicle the growth in my beliefs (again, hopefully in a somewhat coherent manner).

To all the readers, thank you for taking the time to look at my ramblings. I'm glad you're here. Let's get started!

## Why do this?

Because, honestly, blindness is just not a good strategy.
